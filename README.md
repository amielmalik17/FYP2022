My Final Year Project during my study at Monash University entitled "Prototype development and evaluation of passive exoskeleton for oil palm harvesting". 
The purpose of this project was to develop a feasible prototype passive exoskeleton that can be used by oil palm harvesters during the intestive task of oil palm harvesting.
The need for the exoskeleton arised due to the onset of muscular fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders in harvesters.
After the prototype was built, it was evaulated quantitively in a simulated testing rig using EMG and IMU sensors to obtain tangible results.
