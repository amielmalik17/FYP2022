My Final Year Project during my study at Monash University entitled "Prototype development and evaluation of passive exoskeleton for oil palm harvesting". 
The purpose of this project was to develop a feasible passive exoskeleton prototype that can be used by oil palm harvesters.
After the prototype was built, it was evaluated quantitively in a simulated testing rig using EMG and IMU sensors to obtain tangible results.
